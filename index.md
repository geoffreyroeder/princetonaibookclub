### _Who are we?_

The Princeton AI Book Club is a group of faculty, postdocs, and grad students at Princeton who meet regularly throughout the year to discuss books and review papers about AI and its potential application areas. The book club's goal is to foster a safe and exciting AI learning environment at Princeton, build community, and spark fruitful collaborations. 

The Princeton AI Book Club is co-organized by Asst. Professor [Adji Bousso Dieng](https://adjidieng.github.io/) Adji Bousso Dieng and PhD student [Geoffrey Roeder](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~groeder/)

### _Club Vision and Goals_

Our goal is to foster an exciting and inclusive community around AI research at Princeton. But, there can be no community without commitment and participation. We require each member to commit to attending every session with the exception of medical reasons, family reasons, or university requirements.

### _What are the club activities?_

Each week, the club meets for 2 hours to discuss a book or review article on AI or its application areas. The discussion will be led by a member of the club, and another member will record the minutes: topics discussed, ideas proposed. Lunch/snacks will be provided.

### _Membership rules_

We expect each member to abide by the following membership rules:

1. Show respect and kindness towards others
2. Attend each week
3. Complete the required readings each week
4. Fill the role of scribe at least once per year
5. Fill the role of meeting leader at least once per year
